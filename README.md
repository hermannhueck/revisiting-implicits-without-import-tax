# Revisiting implicits without import tax

This repo contains the code samples from the blog post
"revisiting implicits without import tax" which you can find here:

The post is a detailed review on Scala implicits. It was written
in 2011 testing implicit parameter resolution in Scala 2.9.

I copied and pasted (and slightly modified) the code from the post
in order to see how resolution of implicit parameters behaves in
Scala 2.12.
